 Window List Component 1.5 by Jerry Ryle

 This component will enumerate windows and return
 information about them in the Windows property.
 The component currently returns a handle, caption text,
 associated ProcessID, visibility, and dimensions.

 The component appears in the System palette.

 This component is completely free of course. If you find
 it useful, and are compelled to send me cash, beer, or
 dead things in envelopes, please feel free to do so.

 NEW in 1.5:

  I accidentally uploaded an older version of my source code
  with a nasty bug in the refresh procedure. I forgot to clear
  the Window List before rebuilding it.  Thanks to Serge who
  found this bug and suggested a few other improvements!

  In TWindowObject, Handle is now named WinHandle, Caption is
  now WinCaption, and two new properties have been added.

  The refresh procedure now clears the list before
  rebuilding it. (*doh!*)

  The component no longer builds the list in design time,
  since it wasn't really necessary. I was only having it
  do this before for debugging purposes.

  Thanks again Serge!

- Types -------------------------------------------------------

  TWindowObject = record
                    WinHandle     : HWnd;    {Window Handle}
                    WinCaption    : String;  {Window Caption Text (If any)}
                    ProcessID     : Integer; {Process the window belongs to}
                    IsVisible     : Boolean; {Is the window visible?}
                    WindowRect    : TRect;   {Window Dimensions}
                    IsEnabled     : Boolean; {Is the window enabled for mouse/keyboard input?}
                    IsIconic      : Boolean; {Is the window minimized?}
                  end;


- Properties ---------------------------------------------------

  Windows[Index : Integer]: TWindowObject
    {This property contains a list of window information which is filled in on creation
     and whenever the Refresh procedure is called. Note that the index is zero based.}

  Count : Integer
    {This is the number of windows that the Windows property contains. To access the
     last window in the list, you would reference ...Windows[Count-1]... since the
     Windows index is zero based}

- Procedures----------------------------------------------------

  Refresh
    {This procedure will update the window list. It should be called whenever
     current information is needed}
